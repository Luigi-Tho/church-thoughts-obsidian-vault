# My Dedication Verse

## Jeremiah 1:5

Jeremiah 1:5 — “‘Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.’”

## Reflection

What I’m seeing from this:
- God truly does care about me
- He had me set apart from the beginning
	- set apart -> hear God better + more often
- Part of my calling = prophet
