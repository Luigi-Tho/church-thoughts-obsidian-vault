### Takeaways so far
- response to wickedness  = intercession (prayer on behalf of others)
	- Sociology class? that entire class is just “look! (American) society kinda stinks! every part of it!”
- God gives as many reminders as we need that He’ll do what He said He’s gonna do

### Takeaways so far

	- ask God for faith
		- do great things on Earth
		- cut off what He asks me to
		- want Him more, and let Him into every area of my life
- God provides not just the resources for me be ok, but also the abundance to give back to Him (first fruits)
	- tithe money
	- extra time to serve, hang out w Him, + witness to people
	- extra energy to serve, hang out w Him, + witness to people
