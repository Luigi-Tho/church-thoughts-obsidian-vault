# BRP Day 17: Genesis 18 and Matthew 17

## Genesis 18

}
```
### Takeaways so far
- response to wickedness  = intercession (prayer on behalf of others)
	- Sociology class? that entire class is just “look! (American) society kinda stinks! every part of it!”
- God gives as many reminders as we need that He’ll do what He said He’s gonna do

## Matthew 17

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Attachments/Ink/Writing/2025.3.28 - 12.26pm.writing"
}
```
### Takeaways so far
- it doesn’t take much faith to do the things God calls me to do, but it takes an amount > 0
	- ask God for faith
		- do great things on Earth
		- cut off what He asks me to
		- want Him more, and let Him into every area of my life
- God provides not just the resources for me be ok, but also the abundance to give back to Him (first fruits)
	- tithe money
	- extra time to serve, hang out w Him, + witness to people
	- extra energy to serve, hang out w Him, + witness to people

## Overall Takeaways
- I need to start interceding for my places of influences again (fell off junior year)
- ask God for faith
		- do great things on Earth
		- cut off what He asks me to
		- want Him more, and let Him into every area of my life
- Bare minimum: treat my time + energy like I'm tithing it to God
	- hopefully better than how I treat my money right now

## Reflection

Figured out why my prayers feel so unsure: the faith isn't there. I (knew this already but I) value not being disappointed if being bold doesn't work out vs having faith that whatever out-there thing I'm asking for will come to pass, because I would know God's character. It's a 2 part-er.
1. Know God's character more to be able to pray His will more accurately
2. Have faith that what I'm praying in God's name will happen

What I chose to Pray about:
- marriage
	- damage done by Satan
		- abuse
		- divorce
		- parents/family + partners
	- Jesus-centered marriage
- family
	- similar to marriage prayer
- economy
	- my finances
		- Jesus-centered financial decisions
		- no more spending money related to idolatry
- government
	- gov leaders get to know You
	- country to country relations reflect His heart for humanity
- education
	- teachers get better working conditions
	- healing from sexual trauma in students (or profs idk)
	- repentance + forgiveness for causing sexual trauma for profs (or students idk)
- religion
	- Christians
		- more of God
		- bolder faith
			- patience w process
	- non-Christians
		- remove the lies of the enemy (insecurities)
		- prayer against violence + division
		- that they'd come to know You
