# 2 Week Fast: March 26th to April 9th 2025

## Description
- Goal: want God > want answers, want peace over anxiety
- Fast: no YouTube unless Jesus or school related, no Netflix

## Reflection
### Day 1 (reflected on day 2)

TL;DR: My attitude stinks.

Apparently when I remove the thing that you do instead of hanging out with God, what you have left is me, not wanting to spend time with God. YouTube was the symptom, not the cause. I’ve either found something else to spend time doing (ex: accidentally breaking my fast by playing video games), or pouted cuz I couldn’t watch YouTube. It’s that scooby doo meme (I was gonna make the meme to show my point but I think wanting to do that proves my point).

### Day 2
- [[2 Corinthians 1]]

It’s interesting that God is willing to meet me in my “alright fine let’s talk” moments and give me what I’m really looking for. I’ve avoiding Him all this time, and when I depart from that temporarily, He’s like “it’s ok buddy”. Like, *why?* It doesn’t make any sense, but nonetheless we ball.
