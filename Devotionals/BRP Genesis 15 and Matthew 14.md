did Matthew 15 instead…

## Genesis 15

This one laid out the promise that God gave to Abra(ha)m: that he would not just have 1 kid but many offspring, and a 10/10 lineage (spoiler: Jesus is a descendant). This promise comes after Abram confesses that he’s worried about not having a biological heir. He’d have to give his inheritance to his chief servant, but God’s promise responds to this. I guess it goes back to that verse that says God will give you the desires of your heart or something (guaranteed out of context, but still). <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">God will further His kingdom + His will, but He sees your concern too, y’know?</mark> That’s cool. God also reminds Abram of who He is + what He’s done for Him. Verse 7: “… ‘I am the Lord who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.’” God does warn Abram about some of the trials his future descendants will deal with (Egypt(TM)). tbh, I appreciate the heads up. Something to pray for, I guess. God also gives Abram next steps after hearing all this, which I appreciate as well.

## Matthew 15

We cut back to Abraham’s descendants in Matthew. The Pharisees have added traditions in addition to the law, some of which contradict what God originally commanded. Granted, some of them aren’t bad, like washing your hands before you eat. But God (and therefore Jesus) did not like how the traditions contradict God’s commandment. I guess it’s another sign that the pharisees lost the heart of what God was asking of them. They only cared about the outward behavior, and not the inward heart posture. This is further shown in how God (and therefore Jesus) didn’t care about what animals they ate as much as what a person spoke. Speech comes from and displays the condition of the heart, so that matters more. What is eaten does not affect the heart *figuratively* (cholesterol is important, kids), so it wasn’t as big of a deal.

Jesus kinda dogged the Canaanite woman fr (verse 26). But she had 10/10 humility, so that’s cool 👍

## Takeaways

- God’s promise = something to hold on to in the hard times
- God cares about my concerns
- God cares about my heart > my behavior (behavior will follow)

Maybe that’s the issue (the more I think about it, the more I realize I already knew this). The heart isn’t there (whatever I mean by that), so my actions don’t always follow. I’m a weak human being (speaking of my conscious actions and deliberate disobedience) who falls off when it gets inconvenient, or I feel tired or sad. To keep this short (cuz I do this a lot), I’m running to other things instead of God when things get hard. I’m not sure the solution is to *just* say “ok let’s, like, *not* do that”. Yes, that’s true, but here I am again, y’know? I need a better heart. The thing is, has God already given it to me, or do I need to keep waiting? I genuinely don’t know. If He has answered my prayer already, what is it I’m doing wrong that has me acting the same way? I’m guessing it’s the former. Answers about big changes like this before produced a noticeable difference (ex: no more fear -> no more people pleasing, tho I may have failed to remove the old habits). I’m guessing I would’ve noticed if I got a new heart. So, the prayer continues.
But I do need to take responsibility for my actions here. I could have gone to God in response to… whatever it was however many times ago, before not doing it became a habit again. So it’s like, do I will myself to try again and the heart comes from the habits, or what? I really don’t know how this stuff works. All I know for sure I can do is acknowledge I fell short… (by George, I think she’s getting it!)
Ah yes. Let me repent real quick.

1 repentance later and I’m see that I’m the problem. I gotta let Jesus take the wheel, cuz I’m driving in a circle. But like, what does that mean practically?
