# BRP
## Genesis 16
```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.3.21 - 9.30am.writing"
}
```

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.3.21 - 9.34am.writing"
}
```
### Genesis 16 Takeaways
- God can redeem your mistakes
- God won’t give up on the promise
- Just because it doesn’t happen your way doesn’t mean God isn’t gonna do it
- Keep trusting in God’s promise
- Don’t give in to the “natural alternative” fulfillment to His promise
## Matthew 15
read this one last BRP session.

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.3.21 - 9.58am.writing"
}
```

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.3.21 - 10.05am.writing"
}
```

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.3.21 - 10.14am.writing"
}
```
### Matthew 15 Takeaways
- remember: God cares about the heart
	- the behavior will come from the heart
	- you can’t use your actions to fake the right heart, either, cuz God sees that stuff
- Jesus is the provider, no matter what anyone else says (Matthew 15:32-39 vs Daniel 1:4)
