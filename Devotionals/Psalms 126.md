### Takeaways
- the sowing is worth it, the tears are worth it -> 10/10 harvest
- God will fulfill what He has promised

### Reflection
1st thought that comes to mind is that God is reminding me that all this work towards graduating is gonna be worth it. Did God promise me that I’d graduate from UM? idk. All I remember is that He said come here, and He hasn’t told me to leave yet. I just had a thought. Yes, my choices led to me getting my enrollment withheld for a while, but it was also an Abraham moment, teaching me to love + trust God more than the gift He gave me (free tuition to a “new ivy league” let’s go 😎). But He hasn’t let up on that promise.
He also promised that He’d never leave me (Jeremiah 1:5), and this is a reminder that He won't break that promise. He’s shown every time we sing a song that juxtaposes my situation w God’s character that He’s never left me and never will, no matter what I’m like.
