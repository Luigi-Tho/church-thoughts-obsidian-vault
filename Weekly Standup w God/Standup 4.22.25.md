### 3. Review Goals
1. Pass my classes w >C+
	- dropped physics, but got advice for next time
		- advice:
			- do all the assignments (pre-lectures, homework‚Äôs, practice exams) in enough time to get then done -> time management
				- pre-lectures in 1 day? (not great for learning)
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">procedure for practice exams</mark> (3 exams per quiz) (applies to all classes)
				1. practice exam under exam conditions -> pacing
				2. grade w no explanations, attempt #2
				3. grade w explanations, make sure you understand them
	- 100% on p2r
	- 37% on p2l -> 77.2% overall (C+)
		- 2nd late day to get this up?
	- Unit 2 Exam for SOC 300 (no idea what school, but feel decently confident)
		- need to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">stop cramming for these exams</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">grace for when I need to cram</mark>?
			- but also <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">make better decisions so I don‚Äôt have to cram</mark>

			- just noticed that I‚Äôm <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">compartmentalizing this standup too,</mark> maybe
