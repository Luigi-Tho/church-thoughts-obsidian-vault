# Reflection
Apparently the common theme between each time I choose to run from God and His call for change in an area is that I don’t know what to do about it when He brings it up. I understand why I wouldn’t know what to do about it, because I wouldn’t be struggling with it necessarily if I knew. I had an existential thing today, while I was waiting for commuter south to come so I could go to band. I was thinking about life: how hard and confusing it can be, and how permanent it all feels despite it being temporary. Nothing like an existential thing to make me want to run back to God again, unfortunately. And now I don’t know what to do with this information :) yay! What do I do about this? Seriously. I don’t know, and running away until I die isn’t working.

### Update 4.25.25 (LG)
Want God more than the answer
- lack of faith
	- life w Jesus > life w/o Jesus
	- Jesus way > my way
- Jesus + nothing = everything
	- don’t need anything else
